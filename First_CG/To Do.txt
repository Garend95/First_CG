To reverse model loading effect:
1: remove modelmesh's material parameter, 
2: remove global definition of the materiala struct
3: uncomment portions of the spotlight shader exclusively for the 

4. make camera global <- done
5. investigate if camera is working.

There are overall 7 meshes for the suit, does this affect the effective provision of the material properties?
the ambience, diffuse and specular portions of the scene.cpp are passed as vectors (or used to be)

What I did that needs changing: Reconfigured the draw function to do a good job with the original model loading functions
