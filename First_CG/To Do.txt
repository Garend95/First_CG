To reverse model loading effect:
1: remove modelmesh's material parameter, 
2: remove global definition of the materiala struct
3: uncomment portions of the spotlight shader exclusively for the 

4. make camera global <- done
5. investigate if camera is working.

6.understand whether there needs to be second resubmissions of the uniform values 
to be able to render the depth map and shadow with full parameters provided for each


7 Experiment by disabling/enabling the following:
dis-transpsoe the normals in the vertex shader of the shadow VS
re-enable the shadow map and depth map in the Shadow FS
which texture should be enabled for the thingy to proceed
re-enable the set active texture to 0 in modelmesh



Assign something to 

Question: is there anything stopping the camera from moving?
